# smipfall22

Welcome to my repository! Glad to have you here. The repository contains all
the necessary code to reproduce my SMiP presentation for the fall retreat
(2022). Feel free to clone the repository and contribute. Using `XeLaTeX`, you
shouldn't run into compiling issues. But if you face any problems, please let
me know. Just open an issue
([here](https://github.com/sbissantz/smip_retreat_22/issues)) and report the
problem.
